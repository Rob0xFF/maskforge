# Photomask Toolkit

> **IMPORTANT WORKFLOW NOTE**\
> The PNG files generated by this toolkit are **intermediate photomasks**. To actually display them on your LCD exposure hardware, you must pass them through **PCBTools** (or an equivalent injection utility) that knows how to inject image frames to your specific printer files.\
> Without this step the images will *not* reach the LCD in a calibrated way.
>
> In a typical setup the standard resin vat of an MSLA printer is **removed** and replaced by a custom mechanical alignment frame that screws down over the LCD, accurately locating your substrate (PCB, wafer, etc.). The photomask PNGs produced here are meant to be shown on the LCD *under that frame.

**Generate high‑resolution LCD photomask PNGs from Gerber, GDSII, or bitmap sources — in one unified cross‑platform GUI.**

The Photomask Toolkit ("Maskforge Toolkit") targets DIY PCB exposure rigs, LCD photolithography setups, and experimental micro‑fabrication workflows. It lets you load design data from multiple EDA/file formats, map it into a calibrated LCD display space (pixel + physical mm), preview at pixel fidelity, and export production‑ready 1‑bit style masks (grayscale images with binary content).

Additional highlights:

- Massive display resolutions supported (default: 13,312 × 5,120 px).
- Physical mm calibration -> correct scaling from CAD to LCD.
- Dual exposure patterning (left/right regions) for GDS & Bitmap flows (one inverted exposure built in).
- Global final mirror where required to account for optical inversion paths.
- Hard‑pixel preview: no anti‑aliasing when viewing at 1:1 zoom; what you see is what the LCD gets.

---

## Project Architecture

The toolkit is structured as a **single PyQt5 main window** with:

- **Left**: A `QTabWidget` hosting three tool panels (Gerber, GDS, Bitmap). Each contains fields for file selection, display geometry, tool‑specific parameters, action buttons, and a status row with a colored LED indicator.
- **Right**: A shared zoomable **Preview** panel (`QGraphicsView`) that displays the last successfully rendered image from whichever tab you used most recently.
- **Asynchronous rendering**: Each render job runs in a `QThread` via tool‑specific worker objects to keep the UI responsive during large file processing.
- **Central settings model**: Display geometry values (pixels/mm) are shared across all tabs — change them once, everywhere updates.

---

## Supported Inputs

### Gerber Tab

Convert PCB copper/soldermask/etc. Gerber layer files into a calibrated LCD photomask.

**User Controls:**

- Gerber input file.
- Output PNG path.
- Display Width/Height (px + mm) — shared across tabs.
- PCB Width (mm) & PCB Height (mm) — area into which the Gerber is placed.
- *Invert* (optional polarity flip).
- *Mirror* (top‑layer prep, default ON).

**Pipeline:**

1. Gerber parsed via **pygerber**.
2. Render to high‑res grayscale buffer.
3. Reposition according to Gerber origin (min\_x / max\_y etc.).
4. Optional invert/mirror.
5. Center onto full LCD canvas.

### GDS Tab

Render a **GDSII** layout cell from a selected **layer** into **two circular exposure regions suitable for 4 inch / 100mm silicon wafers**, left & right, with the right region automatically inverted.

**User Controls:**

- GDS file.
- Output PNG path.
- Display geometry (shared).
- Cell selector.
- Layer selector.

**Pipeline:**

1. GDS loaded via **gdspy**.
2. Selected Cell is **flattened** (copy) to fully resolve references.
3. Polygons filtered by layer (datatype 0).
4. Bounding box used to center design inside circular mask area.
5. Two circular placements: left normal, right inverted.
6. Global mirror.

### Bitmap Tab

Import any bitmap (PNG/JPEG/etc.), threshold it to binary (>=T white, \<T black), then place into the same left/right circular layout used by the GDS pipeline (right inverted). Final global mirror.

**User Controls:**

- Bitmap file.
- Output PNG path.
- Display geometry (shared).
- **Threshold (0‑254)**.

**Live Threshold Preview:** Adjust the threshold spinbox and, after \~200 ms pause (debounce), the tool auto‑renders a new preview in the background. No need to press *Prepare Output* for visual tuning (you still can, if you want a deliberate run before saving).

---

## Preview Panel

The preview to the right is a `QGraphicsView` with:

- 800×600 fixed size viewport.
- Scroll/pan (drag with mouse).
- Mouse wheel zoom (bounded: 0.05× – 10×).
- Double‑click to re‑fit the full image.
- Anti‑aliasing disabled: **hard pixels** for accurate inspection.

Note that the preview scales the *rendered* photomask image — it displays the exact pixel data that will be saved.

---

## Shared Display Geometry Model

All three tabs reference a single `DisplayModel` object that stores:

- **Pixel Width & Height** (LCD native resolution)
- **Physical Width & Height** in millimeters

Changing these values in *any tab* propagates across the entire application. This ensures consistent scaling whether you're working from Gerber, GDS, or Bitmap sources in the same session.

> **Tip:** Save/quit/relaunch — your last geometry values reload automatically via QSettings.

---

## Installation

### Python Version

Tested with **Python 3.9+**. Should also work on 3.8–3.12 if all dependencies are available.

### Install via pip

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

````bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
``

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pyqt5 pillow gdspy pygerber
````

If `pygerber` brings in optional extras you don't need (e.g., heavy parsing extensions), you can install minimal form:

```bash
pip install pygerber-core
```

…but you **must** have the modules used in the Gerber tab available at runtime.

### Optional / Recommended Extras

- `pyinstaller` – build a standalone app bundle.
- `numpy` – some libraries (gdspy) may benefit.
- `pyopengl` – for certain Qt backends (not required normally).

You can also capture dependencies in a file:

```txt
# requirements.txt
pyqt5>=5.15
pillow>=10
gdspy>=1.6
pygerber>=4
```

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running

From the project root:

```bash
python3 maskforge_toolkit.py
```

On macOS you may need to ensure the venv's Qt platform plugins are properly located; if you see plugin load errors, try:

```bash
export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1
python3 maskforge_toolkit.py
```

---

## Using the Toolkit

### 1. Calibrate Your Display

Before generating masks, set the **Display Width / Height in pixels** and the **physical millimeter dimensions** of the active LCD panel:

1. Measure the active (lit) region of your LCD in mm (width × height).
2. Enter the LCD’s native resolution in pixels.
3. These values drive accurate px/mm scale factors used in all tabs.

---

### 2. Gerber Workflow

1. Open the **Gerber** tab.
2. Click **Browse…** next to *Gerber* and select a `.gbr`, `.gtl`, `.gbl`, etc. file.
3. Set an *Output PNG* path (optional; auto‑suggests on first prepare).
4. Verify **Display geometry** values.
5. Enter **PCB Width / Height (mm)** to define the active Gerber placement region.
6. Optional: enable **Invert** or **Mirror (top layer)**.
7. Click **Prepare Output**. A progress (Busy/Blue) indicator shows while rendering.
8. When complete (Green), preview updates. Inspect via zoom/pan.
9. Click **Save PNG** to export.

---

### 3. GDS Workflow

1. Open the **GDS** tab.
2. Select a GDSII file.
3. After load, choose a **Cell** and **Layer** (datatype 0 assumed per original script).
4. Confirm display geometry.
5. Click **Prepare Output**.
6. Preview shows dual circular exposures: left normal, right inverted; full image mirrored.
7. Save PNG.

> Large hierarchical GDS files are flattened (copy) per run; big IC layouts can take time and RAM.

---

### 4. Bitmap Workflow + Live Threshold Preview

1. Open the **Bitmap** tab.
2. Select any source image (PNG/JPEG/etc.).
3. Adjust **Threshold (0–254)** — values ≥ threshold become white (opaque); below become black.
4. Stop moving the control — after \~0.2 s the toolkit auto‑renders a **live preview**.
5. Use *Prepare Output* if you want to force a render (not required for live preview).
6. Save PNG when happy.

Left exposure = normal, Right exposure = inverted, then global mirror.

---

## File Output Details

- Output files are always **PNG** grayscale (mode "L").
- White = exposed (light pass) vs black = blocked — *interpretation depends on your optical stack*. You can flip via Invert (Gerber) or by inverting your exposure application.
- Default image size = user‑set **Display Width × Display Height (px)**.
- For GDS & Bitmap flows: two circular regions (100 mm dia by default) placed at ±60 mm from edges (configurable in code; expose as UI later if needed).
- All final images may be globally mirrored to match optical path expectations.

---

## Persisted Settings

Settings are stored via **QSettings** under:

- Organization: `Rob0xFF`
- Application: `Photomask Toolkit`

Values saved include:

- Global display geometry (px/mm).
- Per‑tab file paths.
- Gerber: invert, mirror, PCB size.
- GDS: last cell & layer.
- Bitmap: last threshold.

This lets you quit/relaunch without re‑entering common settings.

---

## Pixel Fidelity Notes

The preview deliberately disables:

- SmoothPixmapTransform
- Anti‑aliasing

This ensures that at 1:1 zoom levels you see **exact pixel edges** — critical for photomask debugging. When zoomed down, the Qt viewport will reduce, but no smoothing filter is injected by the view; what artifacts you see are due to screen scaling, not post filtering.

If you require native pixel blow‑up inspection, zoom in (mouse wheel up) until individual pixels are visible.

---

## Performance Tips

- **Use a virtualenv** to isolate exact dependency versions.
- **SSD storage** helps with very large PNG export times at 13k × 5k.
- **Memory**: Large intermediate arrays (especially GDS flatten + raster) can consume gigabytes; close other tabs if low on RAM.

---

## Packaging / Freezing (PyInstaller)

You can produce a standalone binary/app like this:

```bash
pyinstaller \
  --name maskforge_toolkit \
  --onefile \
  --windowed \
  maskforge_toolkit.py
```

If Qt plugins fail to load in the frozen build, add:

```bash
  --add-data "$(python -c 'import PyQt5,os;import PyQt5.QtCore as QC;import sys;from PyQt5.QtCore import QLibraryInfo;print(QLibraryInfo.location(QLibraryInfo.PluginsPath))')":PyQt5/Qt/plugins
```

See PyInstaller + PyQt5 docs for platform‑specific bundling.

## Roadmap

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Very large GDS layouts may take significant time to flatten. Consider pre‑flattening externally if performance is critical.
- Output always monochrome (8‑bit grayscale). No direct multi‑level grayscale dithering.
- Layer datatype is currently assumed `0` in the GDS flow (matches your original script). Expand as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Gerber render error: pygerber not installed**\
Install: `pip install pygerber` (or `pygerber-core` + required extras).

**GDS error: Cell named ****temp\_flat**** already present**\
Fixed in current version by using UUID‑suffixed temporary cells; upgrade if you see this.

**Preview stays gray / no image**\
Make sure you clicked *Prepare Output* (Gerber/GDS) or selected a bitmap + adjusted threshold (Bitmap).

**MemoryError during render**\
Reduce resolution, close other apps, or upgrade RAM. GDS flattening can spike.

**Wrong scaling on LCD**\
Verify px & mm values; also check that your display system isn't scaling input video.

## Integration with PCBTools & Custom Alignment Frame

This project generates *raw* photomask PNGs that are dimensionally aligned to your LCD panel (pixel + mm). To actually project them:

1. **Generate PNG(s) in the Photomask Toolkit** using the appropriate tab (Gerber / GDS / Bitmap).
2. **Launch [PCBTools]** (or your own compatible image injector) and load the generated PNG.
   - PCBTools is responsible for pushing the image to your LCD controller, applying any display‑specific formatting, tiling, or color depth conversion that your hardware requires.
   - If you are scripting, PCBTools can be called headless; see its docs.
3. **Mount your custom alignment frame** in place of the resin vat on your LCD printer / exposure station.
   - The Schablone is a rigid, screw‑down plate that registers your workpiece (PCB panel, wafer, photoresist slide) to the LCD pixel grid.
   - Ensure the mechanical offsets used to design the Schablone match the display geometry you entered in the Photomask Toolkit.
4. **Expose**: With the workpiece secured under the alignment frame, command PCBTools (or your control software) to display the injected PNG at native resolution, full screen, 1:1 pixels.

### Alignment Tips

- Always verify orientation (mirrored vs non‑mirrored) across Toolkit → PCBTools → LCD.
- Run a fiducial test pattern first; measure overlay accuracy.
- Lock display scaling: no OS/window manager scaling! Use kiosk/fullscreen raw frame push if possible.

### File Naming

For smooth handoff to PCBTools, consider these conventions:

```
<project>_<layer>_<rev>_<dpi>.png
board_topmask_r02_native.png
```

Include mm dimensions in the repo metadata (README / YAML), since binary pixel size is implicit once display is calibrated.

> **Reminder:** The Photomask Toolkit does *not* talk directly to your LCD hardware. PCBTools (or similar) is the bridge.
